Moveitems
=====

The moveitems script was designed in order to allow administrators to easily migrate their folder structures to the new format.  
In effect, all items in the previous folder structure will also be migrated to the desired new folder structure as it exists within Zarafa.  
The administrator may choose to either keep or delete (default) the previous folder structure.  

In order to use the script a mapping must be created within the moveitems.cfg which states both the source and destination folders.
